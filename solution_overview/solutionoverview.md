The setup process for Joule with SAP applications requires integration across multiple SAP components as depicted in the picture below.  This purpose of this guide is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up a unified Joule instance that can work across multiple SAP solutions.  In this mission I will primarily focus on Joule configuration in the SAP BTP environment while other solution-specific-configuration is covered in separate missions.
